## 🚀 Exciting Insights from My Latest Data Clustering Project! 🚀

### Dataset Challenges and Clustering Solutions

Even after thorough cleaning, datasets are not always perfect for clustering. My complex project combines DBSCAN for removing and analyzing outliers, K-means for clustering, and PCA for visualization, which together reveal a more detailed real-world scenario.

### 🔍 Situation
The marketing team requested the identification of outliers from a dataset. They aim to analyze these outliers first, and then I will assist them in grouping the remaining data. This is to ensure the highest accuracy in customer segmentation to enhance their marketing campaigns.

1. **1️⃣ Using DBSCAN to Identify Outliers**
   I begin by applying DBSCAN to detect and segregate outliers to a new dataset. This step is crucial, especially where data points are densely clustered in certain regions, with other points scattered further apart. If our dataset’s distribution proves challenging, and the marketing team needs to analyze 10% or 20% of outliers, we can switch to using an isolation forest to accurately subtract this percentage and continue with the rest of the dataset.

2. **2️⃣ Applying K-means for Clustering**
   Next, I use K-means to determine the number of clusters in the dataset and let the computer handle the heavy lifting. After determining 'k' (the number of clusters), I will revisit the discussion with the marketing team to decide on the number of clusters based on the data attributes.

3. **3️⃣ Visualization with PCA**
   To make our findings easily interpretable, I visualize them using PCA. It’s much easier to grasp complex relationships in a picture—a picture but worth a thousand words.

I hope this helps you!
