Machine Learning: Anomaly Detection - Part 2: DBSCAN

Last post, I wrote about Isolation Forest, a method that efficiently pinpoints outliers in data. This time, let's explore another potent technique—DBSCAN
Why DBSCAN? DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a robust clustering method that excels in identifying anomalies in datasets with complex structures.
This method groups together closely packed points and marks as outliers those that lie alone in low-density regions. Its capability to handle noise and outliers makes it exceptionally suitable for anomaly detection.
Preparing Your Data for DBSCAN To ensure the most effective use of the DBSCAN method, your data needs to be well-prepared. Follow these essential steps:

Set the correct row granularity: Confirm each row in your dataset represents an independent observation.
Handle missing values: Fill in or eliminate null values to ensure the dataset is complete, as missing data can skew the algorithm’s performance.
Ensure numeric data: Transform all relevant data columns into numeric formats, as DBSCAN requires numerical input to measure distances between points.
Feature Engineering: Consider which features could significantly reveal anomalies based on the dataset’s density distribution.
Scaling: Since DBSCAN relies on a distance measure to form clusters, scaling your features to a uniform range is crucial to prevent biases toward high magnitude features.
