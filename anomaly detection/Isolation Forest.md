Machine Learning: Anomaly Detection - P1. Isolation Forest

Anomaly detection is an important task in data analysis, often used to identify unusual patterns or outliers. 
We commonly use visualization techniques such as box plots and scatter plots for this purpose. However, today I want to introduce a powerful and straightforward machine learning method called Isolation Forest.

Why Isolation Forest?
Isolation Forest is a popular and efficient method for identifying anomalies in large datasets.
Unlike traditional statistical methods, it isolates outliers by randomly selecting a feature and splitting data points. 
The idea is that anomalies are easier to isolate because they differ significantly from normal instances.

Preparing Your Data for Isolation Forest

Before applying this method, it’s crucial to ensure your data is clean and formatted correctly for machine learning. Here are some key steps:
Set the correct row granularity: Make sure each row represents a meaningful observation in your dataset.
Handle missing values: Ensure all columns are non-null, as machine learning algorithms require complete data.
Ensure numeric data: Convert columns to numeric format where necessary.
Feature Engineering: Create and select useful features that may help the model detect anomalies effectively.
Scaling: Normalize or standardize your data to bring all features onto a similar scale, which can significantly improve the model’s performance.
