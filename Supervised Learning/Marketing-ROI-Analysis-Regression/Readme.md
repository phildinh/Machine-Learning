# Marketing Campaign Analysis for Hospital Accounts 🏥

## Project Overview 📊

This project provides an in-depth analysis of marketing strategies across various hospital account types to predict their effectiveness in terms of the revenue generated, referred to as "Amount Collected." Using regression analysis, the study examines the influence of different campaign modes—emails, flyers, and phone calls—on revenue outcomes.

## Objective 🎯

The goal is to determine which marketing tactics are most effective at generating revenue and to assess the performance of these tactics across different hospital sizes.

## Background 📑

Hospitals are categorized by size (Big, Medium, Small) and receive tailored marketing campaigns. This project aims to quantify the effectiveness of each marketing strategy in these diverse settings to guide resource allocation.
